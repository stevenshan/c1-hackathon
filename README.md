Hackathon project for Capital One Software Engineering Summit. The idea is a program that automatically rounds all digital purchases to the nearest dollar and donates the rounded portion to a chosen charity. The web app portion of the project allows users to view their charity donation balance and view suggested/popular charities. There is also a chrome extension that triggers that donation everytime a purchase is made online (only works in Amazon checkout at the moment) and gives users a small summary of their balances.

Tech used:
- Capital One Nessie API
- Python Flask
- Google Maps API
- Charity Navigator API
- Databases
  - Redis
  - Firebase
